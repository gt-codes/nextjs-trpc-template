This is a basic template using [TRPC](https://trpc.io/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Getting Started

Run `yarn` to install the dependencies _(this project uses **yarn** but feel free to use whatever package manager you're most comfortable with)_

Run the development server with `yarn dev`


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the query in `src/backend/routers/userRoute.tsx`. You can read more about TRPC's usage wiith Next.js [here](https://trpc.io/docs/nextjs#recommended-file-structure).
